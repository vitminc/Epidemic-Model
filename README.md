# Epidemic-Model
Mathematical modelling of the spread of an infectious disease in the population.

The model allows to calculate different epidemic characteristics such as

-	Epidemic time with and without restrictions
-	Predict fatalities
-	Impact of restrictive actions
-	Population immunity at any given point by known rate to detected cases

and simulate the development of an epidemic considering the impact of different factors with the help of a few parameters.
For example, for the epidemic of Covid-19 in Germany only few input parameters (numbers) are necessary.

See Data folder for details.
